Zhudi also called [Dizi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizi_(instrument)) is an ancient Chinese instrument. 
Unlike the common musical instruments which contain the whole scale in one piece, Zhudi is not a single individual instrument, but a set of instruments.

When musicians are playing the zhudi, they need first choose the right zhudi with the right key.
Sometimes choosing the right zhudi may come difficult to some amateur.
So I am trying to help people find the right zhudi by a simple function `zhudi()`.
